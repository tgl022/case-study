#  App Information
I used angular-cli-primeng as a starter for this build and then upgraded it to angular 4. Check out the original repo here:
https://github.com/eladcandroid/angular-cli-primeng

## Installation
You must be on a machine with Nodejs/Npm installed.
Download or clone this repository and then 'cd' it the project root directory. Run 'npm install' to get all packages.

Now follow the Development Server instructions.

Below are the original angular-cli starter running instructions.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
